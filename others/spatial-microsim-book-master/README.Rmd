# Spatial Microsimulation with R

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/20914/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/20914/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book)

This repository hosts the code and data used in *Spatial Microsimulation with R*, a book by [Robin Lovelace](http://robinlovelace.net/) and [Morgane Dumont](https://directory.unamur.be/staff/modumont), (with chapters [11](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/tresis.html) and [12](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/abm) contributed by [Richard Ellison](http://sydney.edu.au/business/staff/richard.ellison) and [Maja Zalo≈ænik](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/people/565) respectively).

The book is now published and is available from [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Spatial-Microsimulation-with-R/Lovelace-Dumont/p/book/9781498711548).

We hope to continue to update the book as methods evolve and we encourage contributions on any part of the book, including:

- Improvements to the text, e.g. clarifying unclear sentences, fixing typos (see guidance from [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/2013/06/fix-typo-in-documentation/)).
- Changes to the code, e.g. to do things in a more efficient way.
- Suggestions on content (see the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book/issues)).

The latest version of the book can be viewed at
[the book's homepage at spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/).
Anyone can contribute to this book [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book).
