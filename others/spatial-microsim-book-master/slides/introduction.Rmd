## Housekeeping

- Thanks to the hosts, the JRC

## Spatial Microsimulation with R

Aims:

1. To provide a solid understanding of the method and applications
2. To teach its implementation in R in general terms
3. To provide guidance on next steps

## Objectives:

- Become proficient with R and RStudio for handling data
- Understand some applications where spatial microsimulation is useful
- Realise the limitations of the method
- Know about a range of packages for doing spatial microsimulation with R
- Understand code for generating spatial microdata with **mipfp**
- Have ideas for trying the methods on your own datasets

# About the course and its teachers

## The request to teach at the EU

- Links with much of the research taking place at the JRC
- Big Data
- Modelling
- Social impact assessment
- Scenarios of the future

## The course materials

- Based on our book, [@lovelace_spatial_2016]. Digital versions available on-line
- Slides available on-line
- We'll be making small 'code chunks' and scripts available during the course
- Any feedback welcome

# What is spatial microsimulation and its applications

## What is spatial microsimulation?

1. A method
2. An approach

## Applications

- Wide variety of potential applications
- So far main applications have been in health, poverty mapping and transport
- What do you want to use spatial microsimulation for?
- @tomintz_geography_2008 The geography of smoking in Leeds: estimating individual smoking rates and the implications for the location of stop smoking services. 
- Exploration of the energy costs of transport [@lovelace_oil_2014]

## Agriculture

@hynes_modelling_2008 is a classic example

Had 2 datasets:

- Individual level data on farmers participating in agri-environment scheme
- Farm level data with many attributes about the farms
- Geographical data on farms at the Enumeration District (ED) level

For confidentiallity reasons, the individual-level datasets could not be linked

Spatial microsimulation used to create a synthetic dataset

## Agriculture II

Results show the probability of participation across Ireland:

## Tax policy

Commonly used to evaluate distributional impacts of tax policies [@agostini_were_2014]

## Transport

A simulation of the car's traffic for Namur [@barthelemy_parallelized_2014]

Used tools : spatial microsimulation, agent based modelling, activity chains,...

## What's next:

  - The RStudio Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  - Using R
  - Project management
  - GitHub
