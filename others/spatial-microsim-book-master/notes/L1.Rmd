## Spatial Microsimulation with R

Aims:

1. To provide a solid understanding of the method and applications
2. To teach its implementation in R in general terms
3. To provide guidance on next steps

## Introduction

- Housekeeping
- About the course and its teachers
- Lectures and practicals
- Getting help

## This morning's agenda

**9:30 - 11:00**

- Lecture: what is spatial microsimulation?
- Getting used to working with RStudio (and GitHub)
- Demonstration of what we'll be working on 
- Loading the input data (Chapter 3)
  
*Refreshments: 11 - 11:15*

**11:15 - 1:00**

- Working through Chapter 3 and 4
- Performance
- (Parallel processing in R)

## This afternoon

**1:30 - 2:45**

- Finishing up and questions about SimpleWorld
- Lecture: Introduction to spatial microsimulation in the wild
- Cleaning messy input data for spatial microsimulation (Chapter 5)

**3 - 4:30**

- Performing IPF on CakeMap Data (5.2)
- Description and demonstration of integerisation (5.3)
- Re-cap and questions on key concepts

## Tomorrow

**9:30 - 11**

- Demonstration analysis of CakeMap data
- Model checking and validation

**11:15 - 1:30**

- Visualisations
- Lecture: next steps

## The course materials

- Major update of course materials from May
- New improved code is much faster
- And easier to write
- Booklet -> Book

## What is spatial microsimulation?

1. A method
2. An approach

## Applications

- Wide variety of potential applications
- So far main applications have been in health, poverty mapping and transport
- What do you want to use spatial microsimulation for?

- My research


## R

- Powerful *command-line interface*
- Fast - if you know how
- Steep learning curve but lots of help available

## A demonstration of R and RStudio

- Creating, modifying and subsetting datasets
- Functions
- Features of RStudio

# Demonstration of GitHub

# Working through Chapter 3

## Day 2

- Parallel processing in R for fast/Big applications
- Exploring the results of spatial microsimulation

Refreshments: 11:00

- Discussion of limitations and underlying assumptions of spatial microsimulation
- Applying the methods to your own data

# Parallel processing in R for fast/big microsimulation

# Exploring the results of spatial microsimulation
